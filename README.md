# Mango Reader
The purpose of Mango Reader is to give people freedom to read manga online 
without needing to go on incognito mode incase they run into a pop-up. 

Anyone can search for manga, authors, and artists, or sort by genres. 
Registered users can add to favorites, give ratings, and leave comments.

Thank you for reading this and trying out my application.

As for the bonus, I have tried to add search to my program. I followed this tutorial on: 
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/search?view=aspnetcore-8.0
So I am not sure if it will count towards it since I did not nececarilly code it myself.
Look for code in:
Views.Mangas.Index.cshtml
Controllers.MangasController.cs
